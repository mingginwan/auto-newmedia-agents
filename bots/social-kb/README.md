# Social analysis pack

**English** · [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

**See something good? Drop the link and your agent files it into your knowledge base.** X, Douyin, RedNote, YouTube, WeChat articles or any web page: one link brings back the original. For Douyin it can also pull the full comment section.

Install it like the other bots by sending this to your agent:

```text
Read AGENTS.md in https://github.com/mingginwan/auto-newmedia-agents and set yourself up as the social-kb (social analysis) bot. Ask me one question at a time.
```

## What it does

You send a link and it runs the same steps every time:

1. **Dedupe**: if the link was saved before, it tells you so. It recognizes the same tweet even with different share parameters.
2. **Fetch the original**: each platform goes through its own API. If it can't get the content, it says so instead of inventing a summary from the title.
3. **Summarize**: one-line summary, key points, actionable steps, tools and links mentioned, author and source link.
4. **Compare with your workflow**: what you already do, what you don't do yet but should (and exactly how to plug it in), and what doesn't apply to you.
5. **File it**: saved by topic in `kb/<topic>.md`, merged with notes on the same topic.
6. **Reply**: a one-line summary plus anything worth doing. Every Sunday it also sends a weekly digest with the three things most worth trying.

Say "check the comments" on a Douyin video and it pulls the whole comment section, groups it into doubts, questions, comparisons and user experience, and adds that to the note.

The job description is in [job.md](job.md), the routines in [routines.md](routines.md), and the acceptance checklist in [check.md](check.md). These docs are in Chinese; agents read them fine.

## Which API each platform uses

| Link | Source | What you get |
|---|---|---|
| x.com / twitter.com | AIsa · Twitter | tweet text, author, engagement |
| douyin.com / v.douyin.com | AIsa · TikHub Douyin | title and description, author, stats, video URL |
| xiaohongshu.com / xhslink.com | AIsa · TikHub RedNote | title, body, author, stats |
| youtube.com / youtu.be | AIsa · DataForSEO YouTube | video info, full transcript |
| WeChat articles and other pages | AIsa · Firecrawl, falling back to Tavily | Markdown body |
| Douyin comments | your own browser (no AIsa) | top-level comments and every reply |

[AIsa](https://go.aisa.one/rain) is one key for thousands of APIs, pay per call. Every request carries a price cap and anything over it is rejected. Add `--quote` to check a price first; quotes are free.

> The AIsa link is the author's referral link.

## Douyin comments (formerly douyin-comments)

**An agent skill that pulls the complete comment section of a single Douyin video**: top-level comments, every nested reply and the video details, optionally the 720p video too. It outputs a `评论全文.md` report sorted by likes, plus the raw JSON.

Requests are sent from your own logged-in Chrome tab and signed by the page's own SDK. No paid APIs like TikHub, no Playwright, no reverse-engineering of a_bogus.

### Tested

| Video | Captured | Comment count shown | Requests / time | CAPTCHA |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 7-minute AI tool video | 83 top-level + 112 replies = 195 | 195 | 35 / 138 s | none |
| 46-minute tutorial | 77 top-level + 58 replies = 135 | 135 | 63 / 252 s | none |

The first result was checked line by line against clicking every "show replies" by hand, and matched exactly. Doing it by hand took about 6 minutes.

### How it works

Douyin's web comment API needs risk-control parameters such as a_bogus, msToken and uifid. Calling the reply endpoint with only `device_platform` and `aid` immediately triggers a click-the-characters CAPTCHA and the request hangs, because it's missing the 30-odd common parameters every normal page request carries.

So the skill doesn't build parameters itself. It **replays the page's own real request**:

1. `page_hook.js`: intercepts the first comment request the page sends and keeps its URL and headers as a template.
2. `page_fetch.js` (main path): every later request only swaps `aweme_id`, `cursor` and `comment_id` and copies the rest. Requests go out as XHR from inside the page, and the page's SDK adds the signature.
3. `page_ui_expand.js` (fallback): clicks each "show N replies" in the comment section so the page sends the requests itself, and only captures the responses. Slower, but it never trips risk control.
4. `recv.py`: a local receiver; the page POSTs each response page to `127.0.0.1`, where it's saved to disk.
5. `build_report.py`: merges and dedupes, checks every thread's reply count is complete, then writes `评论全文.md`.

Requests are spaced 2–4 seconds apart, with an extra 8–15 second pause every 15 requests.

### Install just this skill (Claude Code)

You need Claude Code connected to the Claude in Chrome extension (run `/chrome` in Claude Code), Chrome logged in to Douyin, Python 3 and curl.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mingginwan/auto-newmedia-agents.git ~/auto-newmedia-agents
ln -s ~/auto-newmedia-agents/bots/social-kb/douyin-comments ~/.claude/skills/douyin-comments
```

If `~/.claude/skills/douyin-comments` already exists, check what's in it before replacing it. Then give Claude Code a Douyin video link and ask for the comments:

```text
Pull the comment section of this video: https://www.douyin.com/video/7xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Three link types work: `douyin.com/video/<id>`, a profile link with `modal_id=<id>`, and `v.douyin.com` short links. Output goes to `.internal/抖音评论/<aweme_id>/` in the current project:

```
raw/                  # template, raw response pages, receiver log
comments_top.json     # top-level comments (deduped)
comments_replies.json # replies (deduped)
评论全文.md            # sorted by likes, replies indented under their comment
参考视频.mp4           # optional video
```

To use it in Grok Bot or other agents, see "在其他 Agent 里用" (using it in other agents) at the end of [SKILL.md](douyin-comments/SKILL.md).

### Installed douyin-comments before?

The old install was `git clone .../douyin-comments.git ~/.claude/skills/douyin-comments`, with the skill at the repo root. The skill now lives in a subfolder, so after `git pull` that folder is no longer a skill. Reinstall using the steps above: move the old folder out of the way, clone, and create the symlink. The old `Pluviobyte/douyin-comments` URL redirects here.

### Limits of the comments module

- **It never solves CAPTCHAs.** If one appears, the skill stops; you solve it in Chrome yourself, then it continues.
- Single videos only. It doesn't bulk-collect a creator's videos, and doesn't handle RedNote or Bilibili comments.
- Deleted, folded or author-only comments aren't returned by the API, so the total can be slightly below the count shown on the video.
- Videos with over a thousand comments: after about 500 top-level comments the API starts returning duplicates and folded comments can't be fetched. One test got 823 of 1067.
- Not yet tested: paging when a single thread has more than 20 replies; running inside Grok Bot and other agents.
