# auto-newmedia-agents

### Daily automotive new-media topic monitoring, run by an agent.

**Track new models, competitor moves, policy, owner complaints and viral content in five daily sweeps; drop in a link and get it broken down and filed into a knowledge base.**<br>
These jobs repeat daily and follow fixed steps, which makes them perfect SOPs for an agent.<br>
Create a bot, send it one sentence, and it reads this repo, asks you a few questions, and sets itself up.

This fork is built for Chinese automotive new-media teams. The main bot is the automotive topic monitor: it replaces the daily topic meeting's legwork with agent-collected signals, graded reports, a topic ledger and a reference-content knowledge base. The original SaaS growth bots are kept below for reference. Any agent that can run terminal commands and keep long-lived instructions can use them.

> **Coming from douyin-comments?** The Douyin comments skill still lives in the social analysis pack at [`bots/social-kb/douyin-comments/`](bots/social-kb/douyin-comments/SKILL.md), unchanged. See [how to reinstall](bots/social-kb/README.md#installed-douyin-comments-before).

**The whole system runs on three rules:**

1. **Scripts do the deterministic work**: collecting, deduping, scoring and logging. Results are reproducible and replayable, never a model's "feeling".
2. **The agent judges**: it reads what the scripts produce, then analyzes, extracts, verifies and reports. If data is missing it says so instead of making things up.
3. **You decide**: the agent only pushes conclusions. Spending money, sending anything out and deleting all need your OK. Every correction you make becomes a new rule in its skills.

## The bots

### Main bot: automotive topic monitor

| Bot | What you do | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| [Automotive topic monitor](bots/auto-topic-monitor/README.md) | Nothing (or your brand and price band) | Three reports a day on what's worth filming in the Chinese auto market: new models, competitor moves, policy, owner complaints, and viral content. Grades A/B/C, keeps a topic ledger, and files reference content into a knowledge base. **Uses public web pages and your logged-in browser; no AIsa key required.** |

### Original SaaS growth bots (kept for reference)

| Bot | What you do | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| [New-term radar](bots/newterm/job.md) | Nothing | Three reports a day on newly searchable terms: new AI products, models, memes, templates. Sources include Google Trends, competitor sitemaps, new directory listings, Product Hunt, GitHub Trending, Reddit and TikTok |
| [Site ops](bots/site-ops/job.md) | Give it keywords and your product | Finds every site competing for a keyword, checks their DR and backlinks, tracks your own site's metrics daily, submits to free directories by the rules, and logs everything |
| [Social analysis pack](bots/social-kb/README.md) | Drop a link when you see something good | Fetches the original (X, Douyin, RedNote, YouTube, WeChat, any web page) → summarizes → extracts "what could improve your SOPs" against your own workflow → files it by topic. For Douyin it can also pull the full comment section |

Plus an unrelated extra, [Trade radar](extras/trade-radar/job.md): watches price moves and breaking events and pushes an analysis. **It analyzes only and never places orders.**

## Which agent

**Grok Bot, Muse, Dot, Hermes and OpenClaw** all work, and so do Claude Code and Codex. [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) has the generic steps; each product just has its own name for "routines" (scheduled tasks) and "vault" (secret storage).

**The author recommends Grok Bot.** It comes with a cloud computer, a vault, skills and routines. These SOPs were first built on Grok Bot, and once installed they run around the clock on routines.

## Quick start

1. Create a new bot in your agent.
2. Send it the matching sentence from [bootstrap.md](bootstrap.md), for example:

   ```text
   Read AGENTS.md in https://github.com/mingginwan/auto-newmedia-agents and set yourself up as the auto-topic-monitor (automotive topic monitor) bot. Ask me one question at a time.
   ```

3. The automotive topic monitor uses public web pages and your logged-in browser by default, so no AIsa key is required to start. It does one run by hand to show you, and only turns it into a routine once you're happy. The original SaaS bots still use [AIsa](https://go.aisa.one/rain); see below.

The whole process is **do it once → tweak until it's right → save as a skill → schedule as a routine**.

The job descriptions and SOP docs inside the repo are written in Chinese. Agents read them fine, and the bot will talk to you in your language.

## Where the data comes from

### Automotive topic monitor (this fork's main bot)

Public web pages plus your logged-in browser: automaker sites, Autohome, Dongchedi, 12365auto, MIIT, and Douyin/Xiaohongshu through your own session. **No AIsa key required, so you can start at zero API cost.**

### Original SaaS bots (kept for reference)

All external data for these bots goes through [AIsa](https://go.aisa.one/rain): one key for thousands of APIs, pay per call, with MCP support. This repo uses:

- **SEO**: DataForSEO SERP and Google Trends, Ahrefs
- **Social**: Twitter, TikHub (Douyin, RedNote), DataForSEO YouTube (transcripts, video info)
- **Web**: Firecrawl, Tavily
- **Trade radar**: CoinGecko, Financial (US stocks), Polymarket, FRED, Perplexity

Each API maps to one function in [lib/aisa/sources.py](lib/aisa/sources.py), with paths and parameters checked against AIsa's official OpenAPI spec.
Every request carries a price cap and anything over it is rejected. Not sure what a call costs? Add `--quote` to ask first; quotes are free.

> The AIsa links are the author's referral links. The Douyin comments module doesn't use AIsa; it runs in your own logged-in browser for free.

## Optional: run logs

For a sturdier setup where you can trace what went wrong, add the [run log module](lib/runlog/README.md). It records:

- whether each routine ran, whether it succeeded, and what it cost
- what you approved
- when a rule was changed, and why

A nightly health check lists failed, stuck and missed runs, plus cost spikes.

> ⚠️ **It uses more of your bot's quota, so it's off by default and the bot asks during setup.** There are three levels:
> - Light: approvals and rule changes only, almost no extra quota.
> - Standard: adds a record for every routine run.
> - Full: adds the nightly check and weekly archiving.
>
> Logs are local files only, so AIsa costs don't change. (The module's doc is in Chinese; agents read it fine.)

## Boundaries

- **No CAPTCHA solving, no filling in passwords, no signing up for accounts on your behalf.** It stops and hands those to you.
- **Directory submissions only go to free sites that don't require a backlink.** Paid and link-exchange sites are skipped, with the reason logged.
- **Out of scope for this repo**:
  - browser-extension batch jobs: unclear license
  - scraping through shared accounts: against platform terms
  - mass blog-comment backlinks: that's link spam
  - real site pools, submission logs and keyword lists: personal data
- Other people's content is for learning notes only, never for reposting. Keep request rates low and follow each platform's terms.
- Trade radar contains no order-placing code, and its ledger rejects position and order fields. Its output is information, not investment advice.
